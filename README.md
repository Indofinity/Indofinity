- 👋 Hi, I’m @Indofinity
- 👀 I’m interested in anything which allows me to challenge myself. I got into coding through youtuber Mike Boyd who, through his determination managed to build all kind of fun and small projects because he was willing to learn. 
- 🌱 I’m currently following a course as a baseline full-stack web developer. But will try to learn as much possible on the side
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my final project for the course. As of now still unknown, but will know in a bit.
- 📫 You can reach me here!
